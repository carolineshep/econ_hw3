### Demand Equations

#Low Income Demand:
lowMWTP = `r low_lm$coefficients[1]` + `r low_lm$coefficients[2]` * q

#High Income Demand:
highMWTP = `r high_lm$coefficients[1]` + `r high_lm$coefficients[2]` * q

```{r}
# Aggregate demand curve

demand_aggwrong <- (high_lm$coefficients[1] + low_lm$coefficients[1]) + (high_lm$coefficients[2] + low_lm$coefficients[2])

q = (p-high_lm$coefficients[1]/high_lm$coefficients[2]) + (p-low_lm$coefficients[1]/low_lm$coefficients[2])

```


```{r}

# how much would high group demand at $2
